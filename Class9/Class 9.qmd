Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.
93.15962 
84.83% is X.ray while 8.33% is EM.
```{r}
PDB.df <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv", row.names=1)
PDB.df$X.ray <- as.numeric(gsub(",", "", PDB.df$X.ray))
PDB.df$EM <- as.numeric(gsub(",", "", PDB.df$EM))
PDB.df$NMR <- as.numeric(gsub(",", "", PDB.df$NMR))
head(PDB.df)
total_Xray_EM <- sum(PDB.df$X.ray) + sum(PDB.df$EM)
grand_total <- sum(PDB.df$X.ray, PDB.df$EM, PDB.df$NMR, PDB.df$Multiple.methods, PDB.df$Neutron, PDB.df$Other)

percentage_Xray_EM <- (total_Xray_EM / grand_total) * 100
percentage_Xray_EM
```
```{r}
stats <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv", row.names=1)
stats
```
```{r}
# create working snippet
   x <- stats$X.ray
   x
```
```{r}
as.numeric(gsub(",","", x))
```
```{r}
rm.comma <- function(x){
     as.numeric(gsub(",","", x))
   }
   rm.comma(stats$X.ray)
```
```{r}
pdbstats <- apply(stats, 2, rm.comma)
rownames(pdbstats) <- rownames(stats)
head(pdbstats)
```
```{r}
pdbtotals <- apply(pdbstats, 2, sum)
pdbtotals
```
```{r}
#% solved by different methods
round(pdbtotals / pdbtotals["Total"]*100, 2)
```



Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein? 86.67%
```{r}
# Step 1: Use rowSums() to get the total count for each Molecular Type
PDB.df$total <- rowSums(PDB.df[, c('X.ray', 'EM', 'NMR', 'Multiple.methods', 'Neutron', 'Other')], na.rm = TRUE)

# Step 2: Extract the total count for 'Protein (only)' which is the first row in the dataset
protein_total <- PDB.df$total[1]

# Step 3: Sum the total count for all molecular types to get the grand total
grand_total <- sum(PDB.df$total)

# Step 4: Calculate the proportion of protein structures
protein_proportion <- protein_total / grand_total
protein_proportion
```


Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?
7434

Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure? The resolution limit is only 2.00A, therefore hydrogen is too small to be resolved.

Q5: There is a critical “conserved” water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have
Water molecule is identifiable. Water 308 is responsible for stablizing the ligand-protein interaction by H bond.

Q6
![1HSG](1HSG.png)

Q7: [Optional] As you have hopefully observed HIV protease is a homodimer (i.e. it is com- posed of two identical chains). With the aid of the graphic display can you identify secondary structure elements that are likely to only form in the dimer rather than the monomer?

```{r}
library(bio3d)
```

```{r}
pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
```
```{r}
pdb
```
Q7: How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object? 
198
Q8: Name one of the two non-protein residues? 
HOH, MK1
Q9: How many protein chains are in this structure? 
2

Q10. Which of the packages above is found only on BioConductor and not CRAN? 
msa
Q11. Which of the above packages is not found on BioConductor or CRAN?: 
Grantlab/bio3d-view
Q12. True or False? Functions from the devtools package can be used to install packages from GitHub and BitBucket? True

```{r}
library(bio3d)
aa <- get.seq("1ake_A")
aa
```
Q13. How many amino acids are in this sequence, i.e. how long is this sequence?
214

Q14. What do you note about this plot? Are the black and colored lines similar or different? Where do you think they differ most and why?
The colored lines represent different structures of the same protein (indicated by PDB codes like 1AKE_A, 4X8M_A, etc.), while the black line may represent the average or a reference structure. The black bars at the top indicate where the differences between the colored lines and the black line are statistically significant. Overall, the fluctuation patterns of the colored lines follow the same general trend as the black line. This suggests that the regions of flexibility and rigidity are relatively conserved across the different structures. The most significant differences appear to be at specific points where the colored lines show peaks that are much higher than the black line. These are likely regions where certain structures have more flexibility or exhibit more movement than the average or reference structure. This could be due to differences in crystal packing, the presence of bound ligands or other molecules, or mutations in some of the structures.
